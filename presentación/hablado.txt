The importance of the first fundamental theorem should be clear: it
provides the vital link between the economically meaningful assumption of
the absence of arbitrage and the mathematical concept of the existence of
equivalent measures under which the discounted stock prices are martin-
gales. In generalising from the relatively simple context of finite market
models, one wishes to maintain the essential aspects of the equivalence
of these two conditions. In the continuous-time setting, however, the two
conditions are no longer equivalent and much work has gone into reformu-
lations that reflect the requirement that the market should be ‘essentially’
arbitrage-free while seeking to maintain a close link with the existence of
equivalent martingale measures.
